<h1 align="center">0x04 Error Analysis</h1>

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

-   What is the confusion matrix?
-   What is type I error? type II?
-   What is sensitivity? specificity? precision? recall?
-   What is an F1 score?
-   What is bias? variance?
-   What is irreducible error?
-   What is Bayes error?
-   How can you approximate Bayes error?
-   How to calculate bias and variance
-   How to create a confusion matrix

### Requirements

#### General

-   Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
-   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.5)
-   Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.15)
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
-   A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-   Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.4)
-   All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").**doc**)')
-   All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").MyClass.**doc**)')
-   All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").my_function.**doc**)' and python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").MyClass.my_function.**doc**)')
-   Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except import numpy as np
-   All your files must be executable
-   The length of your files will be tested using wc
