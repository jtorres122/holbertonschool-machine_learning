### Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* What is OpenCV and how do you use it?
* What is object detection?
* What is the Sliding Windows algorithm?
* What is a single-shot detector?
* What is the YOLO algorithm?
* What is IOU and how do you calculate it?
* What is non-max suppression?
* What are anchor boxes?
* What is mAP and how do you calculate it?

### Requirements
#### Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.5)
* Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.15) and tensorflow (version 1.12)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.4)
* All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.* __doc__)')
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
