### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

-   What is a hyperparameter?
-   How and why do you normalize your input data?
-   What is a saddle point?
-   What is stochastic gradient descent?
-   What is mini-batch gradient descent?
-   What is a moving average? How do you implement it?
-   What is gradient descent with momentum? How do you implement it?
-   What is RMSProp? How do you implement it?
-   What is Adam optimization? How do you implement it?
-   What is learning rate decay? How do you implement it?
-   What is batch normalization? How do you implement it?

### Requirements

#### General

-   Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
-   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8)
-   Your files will be executed with numpy (version 1.19.2) and tensorflow (version 2.6)
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
-   A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-   Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.6)
-   All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").**doc**)')
-   All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").MyClass.**doc**)')
-   All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").my_function.**doc**)' and python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").MyClass.my_function.**doc**)')
-   Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module except import numpy as np and/or import tensorflow.compat.v1. as tf
-   You should not import any module unless it is being used
-   All your files must be executable
-   The length of your files will be tested using wc
